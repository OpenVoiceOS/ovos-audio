# ovos-audio

The "mouth" of the OVOS assistant!

Handles TTS generation and sounds playback

## Install

`pip install ovos-audio[extras]` to install this package and the default plugins.

Without `extras`, you will also need to manually install, and possibly configure TTS modules as described below.

# Configuration

under mycroft.conf

```javascript
{

  // Text to Speech parametersJarbasAl-patch-1
  "tts": {
    "module": "ovos-tts-plugin-server",
    "fallback_module": "ovos-tts-plugin-mimic",
    "ovos-tts-plugin-mimic": {
        "voice": "ap"
    }
  },

  // File locations of sounds to play for system events
  "sounds": {
    "start_listening": "snd/start_listening.wav",
    "end_listening": "snd/end_listening.wav",
    "acknowledge": "snd/acknowledge.mp3",
    "error": "snd/error.mp3"
  },

  // Mechanism used to play WAV audio files
  "play_wav_cmdline": "paplay %1 --stream-name=mycroft-voice",

  // Mechanism used to play MP3 audio files
  "play_mp3_cmdline": "mpg123 %1",

  // Mechanism used to play OGG audio files
  "play_ogg_cmdline": "ogg123 -q %1"
}
```

## Using Legacy AudioService

The legacy audio service supports audio playback via the old mycroft api ([@mycroft](https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-core/blob/dev/mycroft/skills/audioservice.py#L43) [@ovos](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-bus-client/blob/dev/ovos_bus_client/apis/ocp.py#L51))

by default OCP delegates to the legacy audio service when necessary and no action is needed, but if you want to disable ocp this api remains available as the solve media playback provider

> **NOTE:** once ovos-media is released OCP and this api will be disabled by default and deprecated!

```javascript
{
    "enable_old_audioservice": true,
    "disable_ocp": true,
    "Audio": {
        "default-backend": "vlc",
        "backends": {
          "simple": {
            "type": "ovos_audio_simple",
            "active": true
          },
          "vlc": {
            "type": "ovos_vlc",
            "active": true
          }
        }
    }
  },
}
```

legacy plugins:
- [vlc](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-vlc-plugin)
- [simple](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-audio-plugin-simple) (no https support)
- [mpv](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-audio-plugin-mpv) <- recommended default
- [chromecast](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media-plugin-chromecast)
- [spotify](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media-plugin-spotify)

**OCP technical details:**

- OCP was developed for mycroft-core under the legacy audio service system
- OCP is **always** the default audio plugin, unless you set `"disable_ocp": true` in config
- OCP uses the legacy api internally, to delegate playback when GUI is not available (or when configured to do so)
- does **NOT** bring support for old Mycroft CommonPlay skills, that is achieved by using the `"ocp_legacy"` pipeline with ovos-core
- [ovos-media](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-media) will fully replace OCP in **ovos-audio 1.0.0**
